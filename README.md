Learning Objectives:
Today, I will focus on improving my efficiency with Visual Studio by learning and practicing essential keyboard shortcuts. I will also configure Visual Studio Code according to company standards. In addition, I plan to complete a command-line crash course available on YouTube, as referenced in our Linear triage documentation.
